1. REQUIREMENTS

 You need Augeas (>= 0.10.0) [1] to build this addon.
 Please note that Augeas (>= 0.10.0) itself requires LibXML2 [2].



2. BUILDING

 node-waf drives building this addon using file "wscript".
 Type "node-waf configure build" in console to configure and
 to build this addon [3]. Other useful options to node-waf are
 "clean" and "distclean".

 wscript uses pkg-config [4] to check for Augeas and LibXML2.



3. USAGE
 
 Examples are in the subdirectory "examples". Run them from the
 top source directory with command "node ./examples/some-example.js".
       * DON'T do it as root * (to be on the safe side ;-)

 Learning Augeas documentation is also appreciated [1].
